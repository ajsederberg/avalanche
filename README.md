# avalanche
Code Authors: Mia Morrell and Audrey Sederberg 

Code for analysis of avalanche statistics and calculation of information for "Neural criticality from effective latent variable." 

# python_simulation_code
Scripts for simulations that were run for this paper. Uses package 'placerg' for simulations. 

# matlab_analysis_code
Analysis scripts used to assess power laws from simulation data. 

Process: run scripts for simulations (which includes routines for converting to mat-files), then 
run 'avalanche_distribution_power_law_GOF_script.m' and 'manually_process_ava_GOF_script.m' to produce analysis output from simulation. Figure scripts work from these aggregated files.
